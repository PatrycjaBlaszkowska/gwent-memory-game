## UXD – User Experience Design

A user experience designer, Jesse James Garrett, introduced five UX design elements in his book The Elements of User Experience.
In the book, he explains the steps of user experience projects and what UX designers should consider at each stage.
This is where most of my planning process steps came from.

The 5 planes of UX are as below:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## The Strategy Plane

- As a user, I want webpage to work on my mobile too.

**User stories are based on online research and my relatives experiance.**

## The Scope Plane

Planning process helped me to decide which features can be implemented withing a given deadline and which one's needs to be postponed. I decided to implement the ones covering my user stories first and add the remaining features later.

#### Features implemented upon webpage release:

- Home page with an introduction, game features and game rules.
- Functional navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages.
- Game page including actual game.
- Leaderboard page to save and store best scores.
- "Home" button on every page to ensure user can navigate easily.
- Footer with social media links.

#### Fatures planned to implement later:

- Option for a user to create an account so he can keep his best scores and access on different browser/device.
- Option for a user to share his score on social media.
- Multiplayer mode, so players can compete with each other online. 

*Above decisions have been made based on below table.*
