## INTRODUCTION 

Welcome to my second project,part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functioning web application with JavaScript. 

The Gwent Memory Game is a online card game inspired by Witcher's universe.

User is able to navigate through website using fully responsive navigation bar and buttons. 
User can see leadearboard including best scores as well as save their own after game is over.
Game is over when player match all 8 pairs of cards or after 60 seconds.

### Thank you for visiting Gwent Memory Game!

## UXD – User Experience Design

A user experience designer, Jesse James Garrett, introduced five UX design elements in his book The Elements of User Experience.
In the book, he explains the steps of user experience projects and what UX designers should consider at each stage.
This is where most of my planning process steps came from.

The 5 planes of UX are as below:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## The Strategy Plane

### Creator Goals

- As a creator, I want webpage to be user friendly.
- As a creator, I want webpage to be fully responsive.
- As a creator, I want webpage to be functional.
- As a creator, I want webpage to be easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I want the purpose of my webpage to be clear.
- As a creator, I want user to like the game and willing to play it again or/and share it with friends.

### User stories

- As a user, I want webpage to be easy to navigate.
- As a user, I want the purpose of the website to be explained      straught away.
- As a user, I want webpage to work on my mobile too.
- As a user, I want game to work properly with no issues.

**User stories are based on online research and my relatives experiance.**

## The Scope Plane

Planning process helped me to decide which features can be implemented withing a given deadline and which one's needs to be postponed. I decided to implement the ones covering my user stories first and add the remaining features later.

#### Features implemented upon webpage release:

- Home page with an introduction, game features and game rules.
- Functional navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages.
- Game page including actual game.
- Leaderboard page to save and store best scores.
- "Home" button on every page to ensure user can navigate easily.
- Footer with social media links.

#### Fatures planned to implement later:

- Option for a user to create an account so he can keep his best scores and access on different browser/device.
- Option for a user to share his score on social media.
- Multiplayer mode, so players can compete with each other online. 

*Above decisions have been made based on below table.*

### Fonts

#### As my main font I used custom "The Witcher Font" to improve user experiance and make him feel more like in the "The Witcher 3" video game. 

*More about this font in credits section*

#### Roboto :

I used "Roboto" Google Font as a callback font in case my custom one won't load. I decided to use it as it's one of the most popular and user-friendly fonts.
